# Innovation Culture

This February, I wrote about Innovation Culture as my final paper for the Strategy MBA at FGV in Brazil. I suggested an action plan, based on fostering organizational culture as a mean to innovate a company's strategy from the people up (before processes or structures or policies). The work covered Roger Martin's [abductive reasoning][0] and Robert Richman's [culture hacking][1]. 

Meanwhile, I'm implementing such approaches at [Grupo TV1][2], the communications agency I'm working for as an innovation specialist at in-house and clients' projects. Also, I've recently taught a class on Innovation Culture for [MeuSucesso][3]. All of this comes from my previous 6 years as a startup connector and mentor (also as owner and editor of Startupi.com.br).

If you're curious about how to "hack" a work environment (as a system of people and tasks) towards innovation, follow the hashtag [\#culturehacking][4] on Twitter and check [this][5] and [that][6].
